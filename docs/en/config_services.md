# Intergrated Service

"Material" has built in lots of Integrated Services. You can set up it easily.

## RSS

First, you should install the plugin [hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed). Read the plugin's `README.md` to install and configure it.

Then configure `theme config`  [url: rss](/en/intro/#url) with the URI.

## topPost

Use this to pin post at the top of the list of posts.
If you want to use this WIP feature, please install `hexo-helper-post-top` :

```bash
npm install hexo-helper-post-top --save
```

Now you can use `front-matter` `top: true` to pin your posts what you want to.
