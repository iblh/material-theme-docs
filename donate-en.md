## What is a donation?

Donation is a common way to support developers and contributors. These developers do not add advertising or third-party promotion to obtain income, only through the use of the user's own initiative to express their gratitude to the developer.

## Why donate?

I (viosey) develop the Material theme as my hobby, and I never bored. However, this, after all, I paid a time cost, equipment costs, and for the stability of the Material document and Demo visit also used the CDN. In order to balance the costs of broadband, servers and CDNs, I would like to use donations to balance the costs of these activities.

So if you feel that the theme I created, the tutorial I wrote, the projects I maintain, or other resources provided are helpful to you, you can donate to me. Donation is voluntary, non-mandatory, donated how much it does not matter; your support is my greatest support!

## The role of donations?

When a nonprofit project depends only on the support of interest, it is difficult to determine how far it can go. All donations will be used to upgrade my environment configuration, maintain the site's operation and improve my enthusiasm.

## What to consider before giving?

The existence of this channel does not mean you have to donate. You can also continue to use without doing anything.

Your donation means that you have expressed gratitude for what I have done in the past, rather than expressing your expectations for the future. But your donation will increase my enthusiasm and equipment configuration so I try to do better at hand.

I will maintain a list to thank all the donors. As I said, donation is a way to thank me.
